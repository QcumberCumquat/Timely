These two operations couldn't be handled during migrations.
They are optional, but you won't be able to search or get participant stats on existing events if they are not executed.
These commands will be removed in Mobilizon 1.0.0-beta.3.

In order to populate search index for existing events, you need to run the following command (with prod environment):
* `mix mobilizon.setup_search`

In order to move participant stats to the event table for existing events, you need to run the following command (with prod environment):
* `mix mobilizon.move_participant_stats`
